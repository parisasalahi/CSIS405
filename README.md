 TSP Solver: Brute Force & Dynamic Programming

This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using two approaches: Brute Force and Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking. It computes the shortest path for a robot (Karel) to visit multiple beepers on a grid and return to the starting point.

- Brute Force: Explores all permutations to find the minimum path (simple but inefficient for larger inputs).  
- Dynamic Programming: Uses bitmasking and memoization to optimize the solution for better performance.  

This project was developed as part of the CSIS 405 â€“ Analysis of Algorithms course, fulfilling the requirement to implement an NP-complete problem using multiple techniques.

Feel free to test the sample inputs provided!
Note that the file named main.py is the program solved using brute force, and the file named dynamic.py is programmed using the Dynamic Programming algortihm with Bitmasking.
