Description & Purpose of the Code:
    This program solves the shortest path problem using a brute force approach.
    Given a starting point and a list of beeper locations in a 2D grid, the program calculates
    the shortest path for a robot to visit all beepers and return to the starting point.
    It employs the exhaustive enumeration of all possible paths (permutations of beeper visits)
    to determine the optimal solution.
